              <p>This is a design thinking journal. We did this journal in class (and outside of class) because it gives me, as a designer, an opportunity to show my iterations, reflections on my design process, and it'sa way to justify my design decisions. </p>
              <p> In this journal, I wrote weekly entries. After each weekly assignment, there were guidelines for writing the entry (weekly review) for that week, in these entries I mostly wrote about my experience with the whole project.</p>

              <p>This research portfolio is centered around the main meal from shopping to dishes, in this journal I keep track of all my research activities and findings throughout the course. In the Research for Design II course we learn to refine and expand our observation and interviewing skills, we then combine these in order to make so-called ethnographic descriptions of a group of people. </p>
              <p> The research I am conducting will revolve around using existing knowledge about human, society and technology in order to better understand the results of my observations and research. </p>
